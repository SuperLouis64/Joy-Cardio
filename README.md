## What is Joy-Cardio
Joy-Cardio is a python based app the converts your Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons into exercise controllers. With Joy-Cardio you can use an exercise bike or treadmill combine with your Joy-Cons to move in-game. While on an exercise bike whenever you pedal abover a certain pace the app presses the "W" key. Same results happens when you walk on a treadmill. Mostly for fun and chill games like Mario Kart however you can combine this with an Xbox controller and beat Elden Ring by literally exercising if you really want to. The only items you'll need to use Joy-Cardio are
- Nintendo Switch 1 Joy-Cons
- Leg Strap for Switch
- A way to connect your Joy-Cons to your PC via bluetooth

## FAQ
1. **Does this work with Mac or Linux?**
No
2. **Can you play Console games with it?**
Yes, but it's complicated. You'll need a converter to transfer your inputs from PC to the console. DM SuperLouis64 for more help with that
3. **Do 3rd Party Joy-Con controllers work with Joy-Cardio?**
No*. I don't have 3rd party Joy-Cons so I can't test that right now
4. **The app opens but does not work what's up?**
Sometimes it hangs trying to find both Joy-Cons. Make sure they are connected to your PC before launching the app and if you're having issues close and relaunch the program.
