## What is Joy-Cardio
Joy-Cardio is a python based app the converts your Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons into exercise controllers. With Joy-Cardio you can use an exercise bike or treadmill combine with your Joy-Cons to move in-game. While on an exercise bike whenever you pedal abover a certain pace the app presses the "W" key. Same results happens when you walk on a treadmill. Mostly for fun and chill games like Mario Kart however you can combine this with an Xbox controller and beat Elden Ring by literally exercising if you really want to.
